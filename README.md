# CIS550_Project
Through our project, we are creating an application that helps tourists visiting a city find and recommend an airbnb that best suits their living and traveling needs, so that they can choose places closer to the activities and restaurants they want to visit and explore.<br>

The data folder contains the airbnb and yelp datasets that we have cleaned and we are currently using. The server folder contains the backend portion of our project: routes.js, which specifies our API's routes handler functions, and server.js, which contains the code for the routed HTTP application.<br>

To run our project locally, simply go to server folder and run 'npm start', and then go to client folder and run 'npm start'. From there, you can play around with our project!
